### Building the app locally
Clone the repo to your machine and run this command inside the folder
```
$ make build
```
This will create an executable in the `bin` folder in the repo.

### Roadmap
* Beautify the mine counter and timer displays
* Create custom difficulty game
* Save game stats locally
* 'About' screen to show info about the app
* Create downloadable builds for desktop (windows, macOS, linux)
* Mobile friendly version
